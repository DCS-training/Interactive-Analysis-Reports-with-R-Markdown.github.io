# Interactive-Analysis-Reports-with-R-Markdown

This workshop will help you create your own reproducible, customisable, and interactive analysis reports through R Markdown. By building on the basics of R, we will show you how to instantly prepare your results into a ready-made document (No more copy and pasting your results! Less human error!).

We will guide you on how to also create visually pleasing tables and plots, so that engagement can be maximized. To top it all off, you will also learn how to add interactive elements to the report. All of this will be designed into a html document, so that when it’s finished, your analysis can be communicated online with the world.

The workshop will be dedicated to exploring and learning the basics of R markdown documents, along with some basics of html (don’t worry, this will be kept at a very simple level). From there, we will learn how to create beautiful tables, and how to automate the reporting of your results section.

From there, we will learn how to support your tables with plots, and how to add interactive elements to your plot. We will also share some simple tricks on how to add other interactive elements to your report. Finally, we will show you how to host your report online through GitHub, so that you can better communicate your research with the world.

This is an intermediate-level course. You will need to already understand programming, preferably in R. Previous knowledge of statistical analysis is not required but will help you follow the content.

For those who want an additional challenge to their skills, we have included an example document of an interactive flexdashboard. It's built on a rmarkdown document, but contains some extra perks to play around with!
